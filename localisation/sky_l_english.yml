############################## Beginning #####################################
origins:0 "Origins of the Sky Reavers"
raidergang:0 "Raider Gang"
kronodeal:0 "Krono's Deal"
origins_desc:0 "The Sky Reavers were a simple raider outfit of the wasteland, rampaging all around. Their leaders were indecisive, but brutal. When a guy named Krono came along, everything changed. He managed to kill the last leader in single combat and took everything he had, including the leadership of the Sky Reavers. Since then, he changed the former raiders to a highly organized bandit outfit."
Buildingtheskyreavers:0 "Building the Sky Reavers"
Buildingtheskyreavers_desc: "One of the first things Krono changed was the organization of his fresh overtaken outfit. He installed a group of trusted lieutenants that directly report to him and deliver his will to the backbone of his forces, establishing more order among his troops."

leader1_desc:0 "While every person that doesn't have a deathwish knows not to fuck with Krono, nothing is known of his identity. Before he travelled to the deserts around Area 51 and became the leader of the Sky Reavers, he had his share of experiences that defined him."
leader2:0 "Krono's Personality"
leader2_desc:0 "Getting to know Krono is one thing for itself. Experiencing his rather unique personality is another thing. The Reavers didn't care why their leaders made certain decisions because asking the wrong questions at the wrong time is a very easy way to get a death sentence. Krono follows this line of his predecessors."
